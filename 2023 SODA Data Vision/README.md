**Title:** Longhorn and the Emergence of Next - Gen Software Defined Storage Technologies

**Abstract:**
As the storage landscape continues to evolve, new technologies are emerging that aim to address the growing complexities of data storage in a cloud-native world. Among these, Software Defined Storage (SDS) stands out for its flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. In this session, we focus on Longhorn, an SDS solution designed for Kubernetes, and explore how it represents the next generation of storage technologies. We will cover its key features, benefits, and use cases, offering insights into how Longhorn is shaping the future of storage in a cloud-native context.
