# Talks
Hi,

This is a compilation of some of the talks, webinars, and sessions I've delivered since I started working with open-source solutions.

I love spreading the word about open-source solutions. Being a speaker has been an amazing experience of sharing, learning, and personal growth. I'm sharing all these materials here, just in case anyone may find them useful.
