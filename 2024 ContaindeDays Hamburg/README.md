**Title:** Lessons learnt from implementing GitOps and Continuous Delivery at scale

**Abstract:**
As Kubernetes becomes the ubiquitous platform for modern application deployment, the scale factor becomes a challenge. With many companies already managing tens, hundreds, or even thousands of clusters, keeping configurations in sync and managing application delivery with complex targeting rules becomes a challenge.

In this session, we will share our experience in architecting Kubernetes environments and designing application deployment strategies at scale for industrial and telco customers. Based on lessons learned through two real-world projects, we will address all the critical aspects to consider, like Git repo design, performance, tooling, and security, with a strong emphasis on the challenges related to application distribution and cluster lifecycle management.
